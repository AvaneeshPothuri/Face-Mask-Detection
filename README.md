# Face Mask Detection Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

## Overview
This project aims to develop a system for automatic detection of face mask usage using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The system classifies images into "with mask" and "without mask" categories to aid in public health monitoring.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Kaggle dataset (link to dataset if public)

## Features
- Image classification into "with mask" and "without mask" categories.
- Training and evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall).
